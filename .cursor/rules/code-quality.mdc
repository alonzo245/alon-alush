# Code Quality Standards

- **No TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations** - code must be fully functional
- **Complete implementations only** - include all required imports and proper naming
- **Verify code thoroughly** before considering it final
- **DRY Principle** - Don't Repeat Yourself, extract reusable code
- **Readability over performance** - prioritize code that's easy to understand
- **Early returns** - use early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability
- **Descriptive naming** - variables and functions should clearly express their purpose
- **Type safety** - always define types when possible

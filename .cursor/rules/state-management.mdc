# State Management

## Global State (Zustand)

- Use `useAppStore` from `store/useAppStore.ts` for global application state
- Keep stores focused and modular
- Use TypeScript interfaces for store state
- Prefer computed values over storing derived state

## URL State (nuqs)

- Use `useQueryStates` from `nuqs` for URL-based state
- Define parsers in `core/utils/nuqs.ts`
- Keep URL state minimal and meaningful

## Server State (TanStack Query)

- Use TanStack Query hooks for all API calls
- Define queries in `core/api/queries/`
- Use proper query keys for cache management
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

# Advanced TypeScript and Code Organization

## TypeScript Best Practices

- **Use TypeScript for all code**; prefer interfaces over types for their extendability and ability to merge
- **Avoid enums**; use maps or const objects instead for better type safety and flexibility
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define explicit return types for functions when they add clarity
- Use type guards for runtime type checking

## Code Organization Principles

- **Organize files systematically**: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types
- Keep related functionality together
- Separate concerns: components, hooks, utilities, types
- Use index files for clean exports when appropriate
- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication

## Naming Conventions (Enhanced)

- Use PascalCase for component files (`Home.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`)
- Use camelCase for utilities, hooks, and functions (`useGlobalState.ts`, `formatDate.ts`)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names when organizing by feature (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`, `features/user-profile`)
- Favor named exports for functions and components
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`, `hasData`, `canEdit`, `shouldRender`)

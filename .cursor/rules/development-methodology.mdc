# Development Methodology

## System 2 Thinking

- Approach problems with analytical rigor
- Break down requirements into smaller, manageable parts
- Thoroughly consider each step before implementation
- Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences

## Tree of Thoughts

- Use a structured approach to explore different paths
- Select the optimal solution after evaluating alternatives
- Consider edge cases and potential issues upfront

## Iterative Refinement

- Before finalizing code, consider improvements and optimizations
- Iterate through potential enhancements
- Ensure the final solution is robust and maintainable

## Development Process

1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints
2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using pseudocode or planning tags when helpful
3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices
4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement
5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant

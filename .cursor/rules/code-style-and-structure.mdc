# Code Style and Structure

## File Organization

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`, `hasData`)
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types
- Use PascalCase for component files, camelCase for utilities and hooks

## Optimization and Best Practices

- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `setState` when possible
- Implement dynamic imports (`React.lazy()`) for code splitting and optimization
- Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach
- Optimize images: use WebP format when possible, include size data, implement lazy loading with `loading="lazy"`
- Use `React.memo()`, `useMemo()`, and `useCallback()` appropriately for performance

## Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases
- Use early returns for error conditions
- Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
- Use custom error types for consistent error handling
- Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## State Management and Data Fetching

- Use modern state management solutions (Zustand for global state, TanStack React Query for server state)
- Implement validation using Zod for schema validation when needed
- Handle loading and error states appropriately
- Use proper query keys for cache management

## Security and Performance

- Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices
- Follow performance optimization techniques: reduce load times, improve rendering efficiency
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use HTTPS and secure authentication practices
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in client-side code

## Testing and Documentation

- Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library
- Write E2E tests using Playwright for critical user flows
- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense
- Document component props and usage in Storybook stories

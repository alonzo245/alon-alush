# Core

Business logic, hooks, and utilities that are modular and reusable.

## Structure

- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `api/` - API client and data fetching logic

## Guidelines

- Keep hooks pure and testable
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching
- Use Zustand for global state management
- Use nuqs for URL-based state
- Export utilities as named exports

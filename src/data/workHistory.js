As a Senior Full-Stack Engineer, I delivered multiple high-impact projects that shaped ZipRecruiter’s core job seeker and employer experience.
      <br><br>
      
I led end-to-end initiatives with a strong focus on backend & frontend development across a broad range of technologies. I worked extensively with Go, Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript, building scalable services and APIs, and drove the migration of legacy systems into a modern Next.js 15 architecture.
      <br><br>
      
On the infrastructure and data side, I contributed to projects involving AWS, Spark, SQL/NoSQL databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB), Databricks, and data pipelines. I strengthened observability and reliability by implementing monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Thanos, improving alerting, logging, and deployment pipelines.
      <br><br>
      
I actively contributed to A/B testing and experimentation platforms (Statsig, internal tooling), ensuring that new features were data-driven and aligned with business goals.
      <br><br>
      
I invested heavily in cross-team collaboration and organizational impact. I partnered with infrastructure teams to deliver reusable blueprints and infrastructure code, collaborated with US-based teams to align on product and technical goals, and proactively addressed technical debt to ensure long-term scalability.
      <br><br>
      
I played an active role in mentorship and knowledge sharing, acting as a buddy for new hires, supporting peers through pair programming, and leading the IL Frontend interest group to drive best practices. Additionally, I lectured on web and AI technologies at the company’s Tech Weeks in the US.
      <br><br>
      
Recognized for my high motivation, energy, and positive influence on team culture, I consistently balanced multiple priorities while maintaining delivery velocity and quality. My ability to combine hands-on technical depth with leadership and cross-organizational contributions positioned me as a role model for execution, collaboration, and innovation within the engineering organization.
      <br><br>

Tech Stack:
Go, Python, Node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js, React, AWS, Spark, SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB), Databricks, Prometheus, Grafana, Thanos, Argo, Kubernetes, Git, A/B testing platforms (Statsig, internal tools), CI/CD pipelines.
